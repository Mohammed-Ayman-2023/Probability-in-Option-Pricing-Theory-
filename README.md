**Comprehensive Framework for Option Pricing Models with a Focus on Monte Carlo Simulation**
This project provides an implementation of three cornerstone models in financial option pricing: the Black-Scholes-Merton Model, the Binomial Tree Model, and the Monte Carlo Simulation. It bridges theoretical foundations with practical Python-based tools, making it ideal for financial professionals, researchers, and students exploring the intricacies of option pricing.

Project Overview
1. Black-Scholes-Merton Model
Analytical solutions for European-style options.
Utilizes stochastic calculus and risk-neutral valuation to derive closed-form pricing formulas.
Includes tools for implied volatility calculations, a key metric in options trading.
2. Binomial Tree Model
A discrete-time approach that illustrates the step-by-step evolution of an option’s value through a recombining price lattice.
Accommodates both European and American options, offering flexibility in early exercise scenarios.
Provides an intuitive framework for understanding risk-neutral probabilities.
3. Monte Carlo Simulation (Primary Focus)
A powerful, flexible method for pricing a wide range of options, particularly useful for exotic and path-dependent derivatives.
Implements Geometric Brownian Motion to simulate asset price paths under a risk-neutral measure.
Supports diverse payoffs, including European, Asian, and Barrier options.
Offers robust statistical tools, including standard error estimation and confidence intervals for pricing precision.
Includes advanced visualization tools for plotting sample paths and 3D implied volatility surfaces.
Features a user-friendly graphical interface (built with Python’s Tkinter) for interactive parameter customization and simulations.
Why This Framework Stands Out
